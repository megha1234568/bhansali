            <h2>Our story starts over seventy years back.</h2>
            <h3>
                From a modest beginning cut to today.
                
                Bhansali is a recognised brand name in the industry offering a comprehensive line of cables and wires.</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6 pt-4 pt-lg-0">
            <p><h4>How did we get there?</h4><br>
       
                We evolved as the cable TV industry grew in India. From standalone operators to large MSOs and the advent of DTH, Bhansali cables played a small part in carrying all the action to the home.
                
                As the telecom sector boomed Bhansali cables carried bits and bytes for leading telecom service providers in the country.
                
                The growth of the power sector in India has seen electricity flow through Bhansali cables. Lighting up residential complexes, powering industrial units and keeping offices humming with activity.
                
                And, as the power sector has increased its generation from renewable sources, Bhansali has been present there as well.
                
                Defence and security has been in the news of late. This sector too has seen the presence of the Bhansali brand. But, as you may understand, we can't say anymore!
                
                This is just a sample of the industry/sector coverage from Bhansali cables.
                
                All in all, whatever be the sector or industry, chances are there is a cable from Bhansali to meet your needs and requirements.
